          <p>Toronto estate litigator <a href="#">Holly LeValliant</a> tells <a href="#">AdvocateDaily.com</a> she welcomes word that the province plans to conduct more random inspections related to trust accounts at nursing homes.</p>
          <p>News of the spot checks comes as allegations that a nursing home borrowed money from its residents’ private trust accounts have come to light.</p>
          <p><a href="#">The Globe and Mail</a> reports that when a Toronto nursing home was said to have been unable to meet its payroll obligations in July 2012, the chair of the home’s board of directors allegedly borrowed $37,000 from the private trust accounts of its elderly residents.</p>
          <p>“The money was returned less than two weeks later, but the transfer prompted a complaint to Ontario’s Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, which led inspectors to discover that the United Church-affiliated non-profit home was breaking several regulations that safeguard trust accounts, including one that bars nursing homes from charging service fees to trust-account holders and another that requires the trust accounts to be audited every year,” the newspaper reports of the allegations.</p>
          <p>LeValliant, a lawyer with <a href="#">Basman Smith LLP</a>, says that the Long-Term Care Homes Act (LTCHA) was brought into force in 2010 to bring better care for residents, as well as provide more transparency and better tools for the ministry to enforce the legislation.</p>
          <p>“The fundamental principle of this legislation is that a long-term care home is supposed to be a place where people can live with dignity, security, safety and comfort,” says LeValliant, who was speaking generally on the issues and is not involved with the matter reported in the media. “Residents under this legislation have a bill of 27 rights, which includes the right to not be abused — and that would encompass financial abuse.”</p>
